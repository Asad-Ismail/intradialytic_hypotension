# Detecting Intradialytic Hypotension
Detection of intradialytic hypotension (IDH)


## What is Hemodialysis 

Hemodialysis (HD) is a treatment given to patients with renal failure. Notable treatment-related complications include hypotension, cramps, insufficient blood flow, and arrhythmia. Most complications are associated with unstable blood pressure during HD.

## What is IDH

Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines define IDH as a decrease in systolic blood pressure by >20 mmHg or a reduction in mean arterial pressure by >10 mmHg, accompanied by clinical symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, or muscle cramps.
